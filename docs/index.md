# About
Snoty is a low-code automation platform tailored towards students.

Organized in Flows and Nodes, users can utilize the components provided to automate tasks and actions. Rather than
attempting to cover every use case using pre-built automations, the end user is merely given the tools needed to achieve
their desired outcome.

Snoty, in theory, can be built to integrate with anything, such as common LMSes, your ToDo-List, calendar, notification
service and more. Extensions can utilize the Snoty Framework, which not only provides basic stubs to hook extension code
into the application, but also useful utilities related to persistence, data handling, logging, notifications and more.
